====

Get your panda deeper into your compatible Toyota vehicle

For those wanting to have the ability to re-attach their camera covers and maintain a clean and simple passenger cabin. Wiring, Bill of Materials and reference photos available here to build your own giraffe for Toyota (Referece vehicle and wiring is from 2019 Corolla Hatchback TSS2.0)

This Giraffe is meant to relocate the Panda into the headliner area next to the overhead console. This allows you to replace your camera cover and keep all wiring hidden inside the vehicle. This is designed to be built similarly to OEM wire looms with crimped wire connections and factory style wire loom tape and connectors.
